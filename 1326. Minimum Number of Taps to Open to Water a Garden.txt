1326. Minimum Number of Taps to Open to Water a Garden

There is a one-dimensional garden on the x-axis. The garden starts at the point 0 and ends at the point n. (i.e., the length of the garden is n).

There are n + 1 taps located at points [0, 1, ..., n] in the garden.

Given an integer n and an integer array ranges of length n + 1 where ranges[i] (0-indexed) means the i-th tap can water the area [i - ranges[i], i + ranges[i]] if it was open.

Return the minimum number of taps that should be open to water the whole garden, If the garden cannot be watered return -1.

Example 1:

Input: n = 5, ranges = [3,4,1,1,0,0]
Output: 1
Explanation: The tap at point 0 can cover the interval [-3,3]
The tap at point 1 can cover the interval [-3,5]
The tap at point 2 can cover the interval [1,3]
The tap at point 3 can cover the interval [2,4]
The tap at point 4 can cover the interval [4,4]
The tap at point 5 can cover the interval [5,5]
Opening Only the second tap will water the whole garden [0,5]

Certainly! Let's go through each iteration in detail for the provided input:


int n = 5;
int[] ranges = {3, 4, 1, 1, 0, 0};


Initial State:
intervals: An array representing the coverage intervals of each tap. Initialized with zeros.
taps = 0: The number of taps needed.
currentEnd = 0: The end point of the current covered range.
nextEnd = 0: The end point of the next covered range.

Iteration 1 (i = 0):
Calculate the coverage interval for the first tap at position 0 with a range of 3.
left = 0, right = 3, so update intervals[0] to 3.


Iteration 2 (i = 1):
Calculate the coverage interval for the second tap at position 1 with a range of 4.
left = 0, right = 5, so update intervals[0] to 5.


Iteration 3 (i = 2):
Calculate the coverage interval for the third tap at position 2 with a range of 1.
left = 1, right = 3, so update intervals[1] to 3.

Iteration 4 (i = 3):
Calculate the coverage interval for the fourth tap at position 3 with a range of 1.
left = 2, right = 4, so update intervals[2] to 4.

Iteration 5 (i = 4):
Calculate the coverage interval for the fifth tap at position 4 with a range of 0.
Since the range is 0, no update is made to intervals.

Iteration 6 (i = 5):
Calculate the coverage interval for the sixth tap at position 5 with a range of 0.
Since the range is 0, no update is made to intervals.

Final State:
The minimum number of taps needed is 1.
The selected tap covers the range [0, 5].
The output is 1.
This means that by selecting the tap at position 1 (0-based index),
