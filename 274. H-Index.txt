274. H-Index

Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for their ith paper, return the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: The h-index is defined as the maximum value of h such that the given researcher has published at least h papers that have each been cited at least h times.

        int n = citations.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            // Check if the current citation count is greater than or equal to its position in the sorted array
            if (citations[i] >= n - i) {
                return n - i;
            }
        }

        return 0; // If no such h-index is found, return 0

Input: citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5]

Sorting (ascending order):

citations becomes [0, 1, 3, 5, 6].
Finding H-index:

Iterating through the sorted array:
At index 0, citations[0] = 0, which is less than n - 0 (where n is 5). Continue.
At index 1, citations[1] = 1, which is less than n - 1. Continue.
At index 2, citations[2] = 3, which is equal to n - 2. Return n - 2, which is 3.
Output:

The H-index for the given citations array [3, 0, 6, 1, 5] is 3.
The H-index is calculated based on the sorted array, where the H-index is the maximum h such that the researcher has published at least h papers that have each been cited at least h times.
