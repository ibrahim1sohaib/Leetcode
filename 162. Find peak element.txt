162. Find Peak Element

A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.

            // If the middle element is greater than its neighbors, it's a potential peak.

            }
        }

        // 'left' will be pointing to the peak element at the end of the loop.
        return left;
