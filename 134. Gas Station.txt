134. Gas Station

There are n gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the ith station is gas[i].

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from the ith station to its next (i + 1)th station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Given two integer arrays gas and cost, return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1. If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique

        int start = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < gas.length; i++) {
            totalGas += gas[i];
            totalCost += cost[i];
            tank += gas[i] - cost[i];

            // If the tank goes negative, reset and try the next station as the starting point

        // If totalGas is less than totalCost, it's impossible to complete the circuit

/*
example loop iteration for gas station
gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]

i=0
   totalgas=1
   totalcost=3
   tank=1-3
   tank<0, tank=0; start=1

i=1
   totalgas+2=3
   totalcost+4=7
   tank=2-4
   tank<0, tank=0; start=2  

i=2
   totalgas+3=6
   totalcost+5=12
   tank=3-5
   tank<0, tank=0; start=3

i=3
   totalgas+4=10
   totalcost+1=13
   tank=4-1 =3>0

i=4
   totalgas+5=15
   totalcost+2=15
   tank=5-2 =3>0


   out of for loop

   (totalgas<totalcost)-> false

   so return start i.e 3
   which specifies that starting from position 3, we didnt get tank as 0 at any other posotions 
   and totalgost is greaeter than totalCost
